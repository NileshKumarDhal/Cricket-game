# Cricket-game
The JavaScript code defines the logic of the game:
**generateComputerChoice()** and **generateUserChoice()** randomly generate choices for the computer and user, respectively.
**getResult() **determines the result of the game based on the user's and computer's choices using conditional logic.
**showResult()** displays the result of the game in the #display input element, updating the currentdisplay variable for future reference.
**generateGame()** simulates a game by calling the **generateUserChoice()**, **generateComputerChoice()**, and **getResult()** functions and displaying the result.
